### About
This iOS app is built with SwiftUI and follows the "Master - Detail" design pattern. It serves as a client for consuming the Star Wars API using URLSession. The app is developed using clean architecture principles and incorporates navigation with the router and Coordinator pattern. The MVVM architectural pattern is employed for better separation of concerns and to enhance code maintainability.

### Features

- **Master - Detail UI design:** The app utilizes a classic "Master - Detail" interface, providing an intuitive user experience for browsing Star Wars data.

- **SwiftUI:** The app is built entirely with SwiftUI, a modern and declarative framework for developing user interfaces on iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS platforms.

- **Star Wars API integration:** The app consumes the Star Wars API to fetch data related to various Star Wars entities such as films, characters, planets, starships, etc.

- **URLSession:** The app uses URLSession, a powerful networking API, to handle network requests and retrieve data from the Star Wars API.

- **Pagination:** The app implements pagination to efficiently fetch and display large amounts of data from the Star Wars API. It retrieves data in chunks or pages, allowing the user to scroll and load more content as needed.

- **Clean architecture:** The app follows clean architecture principles to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability of the codebase. The code is organized into layers, including data, domain, and presentation layers, to promote a clear and modular structure.

- **Router and Coordinator pattern:** The app implements navigation using the router and Coordinator pattern. This approach helps in managing navigation flows and separating the navigation logic from the view controllers.

- **MVVM pattern:** The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern is employed to separate the presentation logic from the view and the data model. This promotes testability, code reusability, and maintainability.
